#the game of bataille takes as many turns as there as carde left in the dark. turn by turn, players will uncover a card from their randomly organized share of the deck, the highest card wins. If both cards are of the same values then nobody wins and they go another round.
#at the end of the turn, the winner takes all cards that were shown and places them at the bottom of their pile of cards.
#game is over when one player has all the cards

# Steps to follow:
# 1. create a list that has all the cards in a deck
# 2. create two players deck and assign in a random order half of the deck into their list
# 3 for each turn, take the first card in the list for that player, remove that card from the list and show it. then do the same for the other player
# 4 then compare the two cards and decide if they're equal or not. if they're not equal then look at which is the winner.
# 5 take both cards that were shown and add them to the end of the winner's' card list
# 6 if they are equal then have them go another round (to simplify we could use color suits as a tie break rule)
# 7 check if one users list is empty, if it is, this player has lost.
